# NYC Taxi Data Engineering Pipeline (Yellow Taxi Trip Records)

This project outlines the steps needed to build a comprehensive data engineering pipeline using NYC taxi data from the years 2022 and 2023. This pipeline involves extracting, transforming and loading (ETL) data into a Snowflake database, followed by creating a dashboard for visualisation. The goal is to consolidate, clean, transform and store large volumes of taxi trip data in a Snowflake database and create a dashboard for visualising insights from the data.
